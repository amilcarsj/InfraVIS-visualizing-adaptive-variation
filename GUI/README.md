<h1> How to use the web app </h1>
<h2> Prerequisites for using the web app </h2>
To use the web application,<b> running a local server in the background is required.</b> <br>
It is up to the user to decide which local server tool to use, but in the development of this GUI, an extension in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) called <b> 'Live Server' </b> has been used for this purpose, <b> which can be found here: </b>https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer. <br>
<b><br>

 Guide on how to setup your local server (Assuming you are using Live Server):</b>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li> <b> 1: Download and install the extension 'Live Server' in VS Code </b>  </li>
  <li> <b> 2: To launch the application</b>, right click on the HTML file for the web app <b> (krill_GUI.html)</b> in VS code and then choose the <b>"Open with Live Server"</b> option.  <br> 
    This step will redirect you to the web application and if you intend to only use local data in your plots, you are now set to use the application. </li> 
  </ul>
</p>

<h3> Additional requirement if you intend to use the web app with data fetched from remote servers (URL) </h3>

If you instead plan to use data coming from remote servers, you will also be required to <b> install a CORS-extension </b> in the browser where you want to run the web application in. This additional requirement is essential to bypass the built-in security policies of web browsers when handling data coming from external sources.
<br><br>
<b> Any CORS-extension can be used for this purpose. </b> As an example for Microsoft Edge users, the following CORS-extension can be used: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cors-unblock/hkjklmhkbkdhlgnnfbbcihcajofmjgbh
<br>

<h2> Using the web app</h2>

<h3> Configuring your plot </h3>
<b> Once you are able to run the application, you have the option to: </b>
<p>
  <ul>
  <li> <b> Use up to two data files within a plot</b>, one file for each track.  
  </li>
  <li> <b>Do individual manipulation for each track</b>, to suit your plotting needs. <br>
  This is achieved by pressing on one of the <b> "Track"-buttons </b> on the top of the page, to specify which track you want to modify. You are now able to modify the specified track by interacting with the different plot configuration buttons on the webpage. <br>
  </ul>
</p>
All changes made to the plot specifications will dynamically update the plot, so the user gets instant response when they configure their plot. 

<br>
For explanations and information about the default values for each setting, click on the <b>“More info”</b> button.

<h3> Bookmarking </h3>
To promote accessibility of your findings, all the modifications made to the plot <b>(except for the specification of which data file(s) you have used)</b>, will be stored in the url.  <br>
<b>This functionality enables the user to save a certain plot configuration as a bookmark</b>, so it can be seamlessly retrieved back for later use in the future or to be shared with others.
