# Visualizing-adaptive-variation
A project within the course of Applied Bioinformatics, using the Gosling grammar to visualize adaptive variation. The project consists of two main parts: the development of a Graphical User Interface for the use of Gosling, as well as the generation of a catalog consisting of HTML pages with visualizations tailored for data provided. 

## Gosling Graphical User interface
A simple GUI was developed for easy use of the Gosling grammar using data provided by the user. 

## Gene catalog
A collection of scripts involved in the creation of visualizations of adaptive variation within Northern krill. The catalog consists of 1047 genes as candidates of adaptive variation, and the scripts are customized for these genes. However the code can be adapted to fit other use cases.
